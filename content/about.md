I'm a passionate software developer and architect, who loves building applications using the Microsoft .NET stack as well as open-source: ASP.NET/Core, Xamarin, Azure, Angular, etc. I also love to talk/blog and share ideas on software development, Agile, distributed systems, design patterns, etc.

On my day job I manage a team of software engineers building one of [Finastra](http://finastra.com)'s products within the Collateral Management Solutions line of business. Opinions and thoughts on this blog are my own.
