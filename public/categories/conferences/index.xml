      <description>Build is Microsoft’s annual developer conference and is probably one of the biggest developers’ conference around; this year’s Build has been a truly remarkable one. Microsoft has made a ton of announcements and released a great deal of interesting updates and preview products. It really is a very exciting time to be a Microsoft .NET developer, and I personally am looking forward to building new cool applications with these technologies.</description>
